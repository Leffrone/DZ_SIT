# Encoding error detection algorithm

There is a discrete communication channel, the input of which is supplied with a code sequence encoded in accordance with the assignment option. 
Errors of any multiplicity are possible in the channel. The error vector can take values from one in the lowest digit to one in all digits of the code vector. 
For each value of the error vector at the channel output after decoding, the fact of the error is detected and passed to the operator of the service.
